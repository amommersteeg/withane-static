        <p>La Ruche Musicale is a Montréal-based non-profit dedicated to making music therapy and music experiences accessible. <strong>Problem</strong>:&nbsp;Though valued by music therapists, traditional instruments can require skills to create satisfying sounds. This can be challenge music therapy clients with diverse bodies and physical abilities.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p>The Bumblebeat is an adaptable, portable, music-making instrument designed with the music therapist in mind. With its implementation of non-touch sensors, the Bumblebeat allows the player to modulate sounds with the wave of a hand. By translating gross motor movements into sound, the Bumblebeat makes play accessible to the diverse clientele music therapists serve and can be tailored to the goals of the individual</p>

        <h3>The Question</h3>
        <p class="emphasis">How might we use technology to support music therapists and meet the accessibility needs of their clients?</p>
        <p>Music therapy is a rising industry in North America that addresses many needs. There is a growing number of music therapy graduates in Montreal every year along with an increasing demand for services. “However, the technology has not kept up with the industry,” says David Kunstatter, founder of La Ruche Musicale. </p>
        <p>Because they saw an opportunity, La Ruche Musicale collaborated with our team to explore the possibilities in this research and development project. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>To further understand the problem space, we needed input and insights from prospective users – music therapists leading group sessions for 6-12 year-olds. In addition to desk research, we conducted informational interviews with music therapists as well as participated in a few scheduled music therapy sessions.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The therapists we spoke to cited that their clients were most commonly enrolled to improve social skills. The goal was to understand how music therapists perceived adaptability and the solutions they’ve found or created to address it.</p>
        <p>The main insights were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adaptability could mean accounting for different types of capabilities, whether physical or skill limitations.</li>
            <li>The role of sound in a music therapy session can vary depending on the client goals. In the context of therapy to improve social skills, sound was feedback mechanism and quality was as not important.</li>

        <p>Brainstorming concepts  in affinity groups, organized by prompt.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do we account for different physical capabilities?</li>
            <li>How might we promote socialization and sharing?</li>
            <li>How might we lower the barrier to entry to making pleasing-sounding music?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We analyzed our refined concepts. Using the <a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/ice-scoring-model/" target="_blank">ICE scoring model</a>, we provided some analytical insight on our concepts and made recommendations to our project sponsors on the direction the product should take.</p>

        <h3>Prototypes & Testing</h3>
        <p>We held weekly testing sessions to collect feedback on our various lo-fi prototypes, focusing primarily on examining means of activation and shareability as key features.</p>

        <div class="flex-around">
            <figure>

        <p>In feedback sessions, music therapists felt that shadow-play was the most exciting concept worth developing. </p>


        <h3>Final</h3>

        <p>With positive feedback from our participating music therapists, our team proposed the Bumblebeat to team at La Ruche Musicale as a concept to develop further. By integrating non-touch sensors, the Bumblebeat does not rely on fine motor movements to activate. </p>
        <div class="flex-around">

                <img src="img/bb-01-13.gif" alt="">
                <figcaption>Moving the body closer and further from the sensor would result in a change of volume, pitch, or tempo depending on the mode of play.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Removing the body from above the sensor would turn the accompanying sound off.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>With the three modes of play, music therapists can tailor sessions to meet the diverse goals of their clients. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Melody Mode:</strong> each sensor plays a predefined arpeggio or single note, enabling the user to create simple melody.</li>
            <li><strong>Maestro Mode:</strong> the user becomes the conductor of their own symphony. By raising and lowering a part of their body over the sensors, they modulate the volume of different audio elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Band Mode:</strong>  the user is a musician, their movements translating to a change in the pitch of their selected sound or the tempo of their drum beat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether individually, in cooperation with other players, or in combination with traditional instruments, users can easily create exciting and enjoyable soundscapes.</p>

            <h3 class="alt">Learnings</h3>
            <p class="emphasis">A problem is often complicated by its interrelation with other problems.</p>
            <p>The most important learning that came out of this project was actually how effective team-building can be to the outcome of a project. When we talk about design thinking frameworks, we sometimes leave team-building unarticulated. It was important for us to learn not only about what we were working on and who we were designing for, but also who we were designing with and how. Read more about <a href="/portfolio/team-building.html" >how the team working behind the Bumblebeat came together</a>.</p>

            <p class="emphasis">Budget limits reality but not imagination.</p>
            <p>Financial constraints limited the practical possibilities of the prototype. However, it allowed us to show La Ruche Musicale how they might evolve the idea as they grow interest and investment. </p>
