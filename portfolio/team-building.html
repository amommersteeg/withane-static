        <p>Group projects are the worst. Quiet sighs, sagging shoulders, and subtle eye rolls across any classroom will tell you that. How do we go from dreadful group projects in the classroom to the office where so much work is done in teams? My experience during the Bumblebeat project highlighted how effective team-building can make for impassioned productivity.</p>

        <h3 class="alt">The Chemistry of Milkshakes</h3>
        <p>After a few battle rounds of laser tag against a birthday party of kids, we took over a table at Deville Dinebar. Our rule that day: no project talk. Over burgers and milkshakes, we learned about each other.</p>
        <blockquote class="alt">“So how’d you end up in Montreal? What’s your story?”</blockquote>
        <p>The business technology major was passionate about two things: startups and craft brews. The only native Montrealer was the computer scientist whose cultural expertise and social networks we came to rely on. And our political science major led a second life as a DJ and music producer. Our electrical engineer, who had made a drastic move from Texas, was a charming storyteller.</p>

        <h3 class="alt">An Engineer and a Designer walk into a [bar]…</h3>
        <blockquote class="alt">“D’ya know what I mean?”</blockquote>
        <p>I did not.</p>
        <p>Before this project, I’d never worked with an engineer. Language creates this everyday magic of  understanding. At this moment, the spell is broken though, by all appearances, we’re both speaking  English. When language fails, how do we communicate?</p>

        <blockquote class="alt">“Sketch it. Show me what you see.”</blockquote>

            <p>Watching the engineer break down our project into analytical and technical categories revealed a different methodology of problem-solving, a different worldview altogether. Creating visual artifacts was a necessary component of cross-disciplinary communication. Hundreds of sketches gave us better glimpses into the mind’s eye than language alone..</p>

        <h3 class="alt">Ego-Busting, or The Beauty of Frankenstein’s Monster</h3>
        <p>Ego can stunt the growth of an idea, preventing its growth into a fully fleshed out solution.</p>
        <p>We’ve put our ideas into the world, but sometimes there’s a trick to letting them go. Our tactic to enable more collaborative brainstorming was to distill what in particularly we liked about an idea or sketch. Then we would remix it. Then remix it again. By the end of the day, any final sketches were an amalgamation of at least 3 ideas from across the whole team.</p>

        <p>When we talk about design thinking frameworks, we sometimes leave team-building unarticulated. It was important for us to learn not only about what we were working on and who we were designing for, but also who we were designing with and how. My team worked at becoming friends – that isn’t always necessary but in this case, the chemistry fostered an environment of play-meets-productivity.</p>
