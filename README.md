# with an e portfolio site
See it live: [withane.design](https://withane.design)

A static fork of the portfolio website code for **with an e design**.

The portfolio is a static website using HTML, javascript, and SCSS. It was a collabrative work with Lindsey Carter in the development of the website.

Most of the code is custom for the portfolio, only the landing page takes advantage of a library called [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) to create the carousel.
